todays agenda:
creating the dimensional model in snowflake
overview of the aws redshift
Q & A
==============================
for data projects if it small - medium we usually go for the either cloud platform or any specific platform like snowflake

snowflake = cloud either aws/gcp/azure
pyspark = stand alone as well as with aws/gcp/azure

why we need to go with hosted/cloud solutions:

1.you dont need to take care about Hardware infrastracture 
 the service = taking care by the provider

2.Capex (Capital expenditure)
on premises: he has buy the hardware ( total upfront amount)
hire System admin, Network, security team for physical thread
environment: cooling system, power backup

3.Opex ( Operation expenditure)
we wil pay the amount for the specific resource (ram,processor and storage) it inlucde networking

per hour 
use it first and pay us later 

Signup and verify our bank through credit or debit card
lot of trail version also

free or community edition/service

snowflake
===================

modern applicaitons we will get 3 approach

1.Issuing command in web interface /console
2.CLI = we will install a utility in our laptop and we connect to the server and we issue the commands
3.web interface but we are using wizard
=================================================

we are creating the staging tables
we are remodeling it ( for faster query)
we are creating the gold layer ( normal views or materilized/standard tables ) 

these objects are working as datamart and available for business intelligence

=========================================================
Activity on snowflake

after creating the account, we can create new notebook sheet and rename it

we create new database
use database
we are creating the schema:

What is schema:
Its logical container for database objets (table, view, materlized) indexes are not allowed snowflake. 

It helps us to organized data and implementing of security
=============================================================

After adding demo data in staging area/table

we have two options

1)use the same normalised model (inmon method)
2)Kimball method which ask us to create dimensional model 
recreating the model for faster query processing

Why we need to dimensional modeling:
===============--
1.Simplicity = It allows modeling to understand and navigate the data for business users because they reflect real world concept and relationship

2.Performance: Queries against dimensional model typical perform very well due to the denomalise structure and pre-aggregated data


so lets create dim and fact tables:
=========================================
Fact table store quantity/numeric values
dim store/hold = descriptive /contextual information

last step:
=============

creating the datamart (subset of the main dataset)
we can regular table or view or materlized view (it store query physical) 
but in snowflake (materlized view support query from single table)
